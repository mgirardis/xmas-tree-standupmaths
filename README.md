This program is a contribution to the twinkly xmas tree lights of the standupmaths youtube channel, related to the video https://youtu.be/TvlpIojusBE

Below, you can find the description of what each program here does.

# view_tree.m

Simple visualization in MATLAB of the tree coordinates captured by standupmaths, and of the geometric cone generated by the data parameters.

# view_tree_network.py

Builds and shows the network of the xmas lights. The network can be built in 3 different ways:

- a lattice-like network (nearest neighbors in all 6 spatial directions)

- a proximity network (a given light receives input from all the other lights within a certain radius of itself)

- a surface network (only the lights outside of the geometric cone generated by the data parameters are connected to its 4 nearest neighbors, in polar coordinates)
